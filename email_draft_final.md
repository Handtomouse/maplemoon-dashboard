Hey Dylan and Carli,

Hope you're having a great week!

I've finalized the AFQA compliance project dashboard with refined pricing. You can view everything here:

**🔗 https://dashboarddeployment.vercel.app**

## Quick Summary

After diving into the bars this week, I've refined the pricing breakdown to better reflect the actual work involved. The good news: **the total comes out to virtually the same** ($7,806.29 vs original $7,790.10).

**Updated Breakdown:**
- **Bars (6):** $1,096.98 - Template rebuild approach for compliance
- **Moons (6):** $799.79 - Compliance updates
- **Bar CDUs (6):** $2,350.63 - Template rebuild (50% master + 15% clones)
- **Bananas (1):** $162.12 - Compliance updates
- **Moon CDUs (6):** $2,350.63 - New designs (50% master + 15% clones)
- **Banana CDU (1):** $940.26 - New design (50% mates rate)
- **Icons (8):** $105.88 - 6 updated + 2 brand new

**Total: $7,806.29 (Inc GST)**

## What's Included (Scope)

This quote covers:

✅ **26 packaging designs + 8 certification icons** as outlined
✅ **Compliance updates** per AFQA audit requirements
✅ **Template-based approach** (Pure Carob masters + flavor clones)
✅ **Up to 2 revision rounds per category** (e.g., 2 rounds for bars, 2 for CDUs, etc.)
✅ **Final print-ready files** in required formats

---

## What's NOT Included (Separate Quote Required)

To ensure we stay on track and on budget, the following would require separate quotes:

❌ **Major design changes** beyond AFQA compliance requirements
❌ **Additional revision rounds** beyond 2 per category
❌ **New products or variations** not listed in the 26 designs
❌ **Rush fees** if timeline accelerates beyond agreed schedule
❌ **Additional file formats** or special export requirements

**How it works:** If anything comes up outside this scope, I'll flag it immediately and provide a quick quote before proceeding. This way there are no surprises for either of us.

## Timeline Reminder

**Target: December 22 finalization** (Christmas deadline)
**Alternative: January 13, 2026** (Chinese New Year print deadline)

**Week Structure:**
- Week 1 (Dec 2-8): Bars ✅ (In progress - Pure Carob underway)
- Week 2 (Dec 9-15): Bar CDUs
- Week 3 (Dec 16-22): Moons + Bananas + Icons

---

## Payment Structure

**Approval-Based Payment (Recommended):**
Pay when you approve each category completion. Keeps things flexible and low-risk.

**Example:**
- Bars approved → Invoice $1,096.98 (NET 7)
- Bar CDUs approved → Invoice $2,350.63 (NET 7)
- And so on...

## What I Need From You

🚨 **URGENT (by Dec 15):**
- Moon packaging dimensions (size changed - CRITICAL)
- Banana packaging dimensions (size changed - CRITICAL)
- Address confirmation (1/9 Nana St vs 33 Nana St, Brunswick Heads?)

📋 **Before Week 4 (if targeting Jan 13):**
- 6 Moon CDU barcodes
- Moon CDU specifications
- Banana CDU barcode
- Banana CDU specifications

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review the dashboard** - Check the breakdown and scope
2. **Confirm you're good to proceed** - Reply with approval
3. **Pay gap invoice** ($811.24 INV-0341) - Link in dashboard
4. **Send critical specs** (Moon/Banana dimensions, address)

Once I get your green light, I'll finalize the Pure Carob Bar and other 5 bar flavors, then move straight into Week 2 (Bar CDUs).

The dashboard is fully interactive - no login needed, just open the link in any browser.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,
Nate

**P.S.** - The scope protection above isn't about being rigid - it's about making sure we're both clear on what's included so the project runs smoothly and on budget. If something comes up, we'll just have a quick chat and sort it out. 👍
