Hey Dylan and Carli,

Hope you're having a great week!

I've put together an interactive dashboard for the AFQA compliance packaging project. You can view everything here:

**🔗 https://dashboarddeployment.vercel.app**

## What's Inside

✅ **Complete project breakdown** - All 26 packaging designs + 8 certification icons
✅ **Embedded invoice** - Gap period work (Aug-Oct) INV-0341: $811.24
✅ **AFQA compliance quote** - Total: $7,790.10 (inc GST)
✅ **Direct payment link** - Pay the gap invoice via Xero
✅ **Approval workflow** - One-click email to approve and proceed

## Project Scope

- **26 packaging designs:** Bars, Moons, Bar CDUs, Moon CDUs, Banana CDU
- **8 certification icons:** 6 updated + 2 brand new (Australian Made, 4 Wholefood Ingredients)
- **Special pricing:** Master templates at mates rates (Pure Carob Bar 50%, Pure Carob Bar CDU 50%, Pure Carob Moon CDU 50%, Banana 4-Pack 25%, Banana CDU 25%, Pure Carob Moon 25%)
- **Payment:** Approval-based (pay when you approve each stage)

## Timeline - IMPORTANT

Based on Travis's holiday closures:
- **Print deadline (Christmas):** December 23rd
- **Print deadline (Chinese New Year):** January 13th
- **Finalization target:** December 22nd

This gives us **3 weeks** to finalize Bars, Bar CDUs, Moons, Bananas, and Icons for the Christmas deadline (Dec 22). The Moon CDUs and Banana CDU can be completed post-Christmas if we're targeting the Chinese New Year window (Jan 13).

## Next Steps - Let's Get Moving!

1. **Review the dashboard** - Check the pricing breakdown and embedded invoice
2. **Pay gap invoice** ($811.24) - Use the Xero link in the dashboard
3. **🚨 URGENT - Provide critical specs** (needed by Dec 15):
   - Moon packaging dimensions (size changed - CRITICAL BLOCKER)
   - Banana packaging dimensions (size changed - CRITICAL BLOCKER)
   - Address confirmation (1/9 Nana St or 33 Nana St, Brunswick Heads?)
4. **Approve to proceed** - Reply when ready to continue with Week 2

The dashboard is fully interactive - no account needed, just open the link in any browser.

## Already Underway!

I've already kicked things off to maximize our time for the Christmas deadline:
- ✅ **Pure Carob Bar** - Design in progress (master template)
- ✅ **Certification Icons (8)** - Work underway

Once you approve, I'll complete the remaining 5 bar flavors and finalize the icons, then move straight into Bar CDUs (Week 2).

Cheers,
Nate
